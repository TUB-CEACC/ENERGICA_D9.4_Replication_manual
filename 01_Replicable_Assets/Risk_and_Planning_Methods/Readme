This folder contains two distinct outputs valuable for replication ativities: 
1. A scaling strategy guide: 
A scaling strategy provides a framework to identify the conditions under which a project, technology, or business model can be effectively reproduced in a new location, market segment, or operational context. It goes beyond technical feasibility and includes considerations such as regulatory requirements, financing options, partnership models, supply chain implications, community engagement needs, and long-term operational capacity.
The main objectives of this scaling strategy document are to:
  1.	Capture the practical experience of the demonstrator partners who have tested and refined their technologies in real-world African settings.
  2.	Identify key enabling and constraining factors that influence the ability of each project to be replicated or scaled in other contexts.
  3.	Provide a structured assessment of scaling pathways, including geographic expansion, market diversification, and integration into broader energy ecosystems.
  4.	Support decision-making for future phases of ENERGICA and for external stakeholders—such as policy makers, financiers, and development practitioners—who may wish to build on the programme’s results.
  5.	Strengthen partner capacities by guiding them through a reflective and analytical process that clarifies their value proposition, operational needs, and strategic next steps.
The guide is implemented via a Excel-based survey. Due to it´s confidential status of the associated Deliverable, the responses of the ENERGICA demonstrator solutions are excluded from the guide.

2. A Deliverable (D7.1) containing a System Dynamics modeling approach and risk assessment methodology:
•	System dynamics models and methodology integrating demonstrator data with socio-economic and behavioural drivers to support scenario analysis for decentralised energy, waste-to-energy solutions, and e-mobility. While the detailed parameterisation is context-dependent, the modelling logic is replicable when supported by stakeholder engagement and relevant data.
•	A structured risk assessment methodology (including DEMATEL and ANP approaches) that can be replicated across technologies and contexts, noting that application results must be produced per case.
