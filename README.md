# ENERGICA_D9.4_Replication_manual
The ENERGICA project has generated a diverse set of results across multiple work packages, including methodologies, tools, models, frameworks, workflows, flowcharts, training materials, and demonstrators. For the purpose of wide replication, this repository contains any output relevant for replication while making a clear distinction between (i) replicable assets that can be reused or adapted in other contexts and are integrated into the public replication manual and GitHub repository, and (ii) demonstration results, which are documented and evaluated in project reports but are not provided as directly reusable assets; however, through reports and other public Deliverables, key learnings are shared and can support replication activities.
The structure of the repository is as follows: 

At the top level, the repository is organised into four main sections, as illustrated in the schematic overview below:

ENERGICA_D9.4_Replication_manual/
├── 01_Replicable_Assets/
├── 02_Demonstration_Results/
├── 03_Public_Deliverables/
└── LICENSE
This top-level structure ensures that users can immediately identify whether they are looking for hands-on, reusable assets, validated demonstration examples, or supporting documentation.
2.1 Replicable Assets
The folder 01_Replicable_Assets/ contains all methodologies, tools, models, templates, and workflows that are directly reusable or adaptable in other contexts. Assets are organised by thematic and functional areas, allowing users to navigate based on their specific needs rather than project management structures.
A typical internal structure is illustrated below:
01_Replicable_Assets/
│
├── Regulatory_and_Policy_Analysis/
├── System_Design_and_Architecture/
├── Energy_System_Models/
├── Decision_Support_Tools/
├── Capacity_Building_and_Curricula/
├── Knowledge_Transfer_Methods/
├── Impact_and_LCA_Methods/
├── Risk_and_Planning_Methods/
└── Ecosystem_Mapping/
Each thematic subfolder includes:
•	A README file explaining the purpose of the assets, their intended use, and limitations.
•	The replicable materials themselves (e.g. models, templates, scripts, Excel tools).
This structure enables users to directly access relevant assets without requiring prior knowledge of the ENERGICA project.
2.2 Demonstration Results
The folder 02_Demonstration_Results/ contains documentation of the ENERGICA demonstrators, structured by solution type. These folders include public reports and Deliverables describing implementation, evaluation, and lessons learned from real-world deployments.

Demonstration results are included to:
•	Illustrate how replicable assets were applied in practice.
•	Provide empirical validation of technical, economic, and social performance.
•	Highlight context-specific boundary conditions relevant for replication.
